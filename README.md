# chinese-hieroglyphics-inspired-ai-docs
This repository is for documentations of my AI project. 
This AI project is not for recognizing ancient hieroglyphic characters. But rather build those hieroglyphic characters into CNNs to enable feedback make neural-networks semi-transparent to users (at least those who can interpret chinese characters). 
Please [read vision document](https://github.com/wenbo-yang/chinese-hieroglyphics-inspired-ai-docs/wiki/Using-ancient-hieroglyphic-characters-as-heuristic-guidelines-in-neural%E2%80%90network-models-for-object-and-action-recognition) for details. 

This documentaion repo stores:
1. Vision document
2. Sketches and pictures
3. Project road maps 
4. Design docs
and miscellanous docs.
